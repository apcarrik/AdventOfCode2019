# Day 14: Space Stoichiometry

My solution for this challenge was created using a Test Driven Development (TDD) model, where development starts with small, atomic test cases, and then feature code is added to pass the test cases. You should be able to see from the commit history that I tried to follow this model as much as possible, by writing tests first and code for the actual project after.
